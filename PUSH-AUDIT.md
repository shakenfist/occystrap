Thanks for your work on this. I appreciate it. Some final checks
before I push:

## Code quality

 * Did the changes introduce any significant amount of duplicated
   code? Are there any missed opportunities for code reuse or
   refactoring?
 * Should any new code be extracted into a shared module? Look for
   logic that a second command or input source would likely need.
 * Are there any TODO comments we should address as part of this
   work?
 * Please ensure all source code is wrapped at 120 characters.
 * Use single quotes for strings, double quotes for docstrings.

<!-- shared-block: comment-proportion v1 -->
Comment proportion (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/comment-proportion.md`):

- A comment or docstring earns its length by saying what the code
  cannot: the contract, the units, the failure modes, the reason a
  surprising choice is correct. Restating the code in prose is not
  documentation.
- Treat as candidates any added comment or docstring that is longer
  than the code it documents, and any comment block over roughly
  fifteen lines attached to a body under ten. These are candidates,
  not verdicts -- a subtle algorithm, a public API contract, or a
  hard-won bug explanation can justify the length.
- Where the length is not justified the finding is advisory, and
  the fix is to cut the restatement rather than delete the comment:
  keep the why, drop the line-by-line narration of the what.
- Prose that documents user-visible behaviour rather than the
  implementation usually belongs in `docs/`, with the comment
  reduced to a pointer.

## Style conformance

 * Does the code follow the project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`?
   Check in particular:
   - Python conventions (error handling, module layout, logging).
   - CLI conventions (Click commands, global options like
     `--username`, `--password`, `-O`/`--output-format`).
   - Pipeline interface conventions (ImageInput, ImageOutput,
     ImageFilter base classes, ImageElement dataclass).
 * Does registry authentication follow the existing pattern in
   `inputs/registry.py`?

<!-- shared-block: python-version-discipline v1 -->
Python version and typing (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/python-version-discipline.md`):

- No syntax or standard library API newer than the floor in
  `requires-python`. Structural pattern matching, `X | Y` unions in
  annotations evaluated at runtime, `tomllib`, and
  `datetime.UTC` each raise on an interpreter the package still
  claims to support, and none of them fail in CI when CI runs only
  the newest version. This is the finding to look for first: it is
  a real break on a real user's machine, not a style point.
- New and modified code carries type hints, and mypy is expected to
  be clean over it. A project part way through a staged rollout is
  held to the new code, not to the whole tree.
- Prefer the walrus operator and f-strings where they make the code
  read better, subject to the floor above.
- Raising the floor in `requires-python` is a supported-platforms
  decision, not a convenience: it drops users. If it is genuinely
  right, the platforms table, `requires-python` and
  `constraints.python` in `renovate.json` all move together.

## Tests

 * Is there unit and functional test coverage for the changes?
   This should include normal and adversarial cases.
 * All tests should pass. We need to fix any failing tests now
   before we push.
 * What tests are skipped? Could we reduce that number?
 * Run `flake8 --max-line-length=120 occystrap/` and confirm
   clean output.
 * Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and confirm all hooks pass.

<!-- shared-block: functional-test-coverage v1 -->
Functional test coverage (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/functional-test-coverage.md`):

- The standard is "do we run the code to do the real thing, and
  does it work as intended". Every subcommand exposed on the command
  line, and every endpoint exposed by an API, should have a test
  that exercises it for real rather than against a mock of itself.
- For a change that adds or alters user-visible behaviour, the
  question to answer is which functional test would have failed
  before it and passes after. If there is none, that is the finding,
  and it is a finding about this change rather than a note for
  later.
- Unit tests are held to no coverage percentage, but a branch that
  is reachable from outside the process and has no test is worth
  naming. Error paths and argument validation are where this bites:
  they are the code most often written once and never run again.
- Mocking the system under test proves nothing. Mock the boundary --
  the network, the clock, the hypervisor -- and let the code being
  tested actually run.
- Where a gap is real but out of scope for the change in hand, say
  so plainly and record it, rather than silently widening the
  change or silently leaving it unsaid.

## Documentation

 * Has `docs/` been updated to reflect any new or changed
   commands? In particular, has `docs/command-reference.md` been
   updated?
 * Has the detail in `docs/` been updated if this change adds or
   modifies modules, commands, or pipeline components?
   `docs/pipeline.md` for pipeline structure and interfaces,
   `docs/internals.md` for the Docker, Quay, proxy, parallelism and
   HTTP internals.
 * Has `ARCHITECTURE.md` been updated if this change alters the
   *shape* of the system — the module inventory or the directory
   structure? It is a summary and an index, so most changes should
   not touch it.
<!-- shared-block: readme-discipline v1 -->
README discipline (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/readme-discipline.md`):

- New user-visible features are documented in `docs/` (and
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `AGENTS.md` where appropriate), not by
  adding bullets to `README.md`.
- `README.md` is a pitch: what the project is, who it is for,
  minimal installation instructions, a small number of usage
  examples, and curated absolute links into `docs/`. It only
  changes when the pitch, the install story, or the
  documentation links change.
- README growth is itself a finding: if the diff adds README
  content that belongs in `docs/`, flag it as blocking and
  move it.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: llm-doc-discipline v1 -->
AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md discipline (shared block; do not
edit -- the canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/llm-doc-discipline.md`):

- `AGENTS.md` is a working guide: the conventions, invariants and
  gotchas an agent cannot infer by reading the code, plus curated
  links into `docs/`. It is loaded into every session, so every
  line costs context on every task.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is a map: the component inventory, how data
  moves between components, and why the shape is the way it is.
  A deep dive on one subsystem belongs in `docs/`, where humans
  benefit from it too.
- One canonical home per fact. If `docs/` covers it, link to it
  instead of restating it -- and the same rule applies between
  `AGENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Neither file is a reference manual, a runbook, or a changelog.
  CLI flags, configuration keys, wire protocols, step-by-step
  procedures and plan history go to `docs/`.
- Growth in either file is itself a finding: if the diff adds
  content that belongs in `docs/`, flag it as blocking and move
  it.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: diagram-discipline v1 -->
Diagram discipline (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/diagram-discipline.md`):

- A diagram of *structure or flow* -- components and the arrows
  between them, an ordered exchange of messages, a state machine
  -- is written as a fenced `mermaid` block, not drawn in ASCII.
  GitHub renders those natively and the mkdocs sites render them
  through `pymdownx.superfences`, so the same source is a picture
  in both places.
- Not every box of characters is a diagram. These stay as plain
  code fences, because mermaid cannot express them and would lose
  what they show: directory and file trees; memory maps, address
  space layouts and register or bit-field diagrams, where column
  alignment carries the meaning; wire-format and on-disk byte
  layouts; captured terminal output; and tables. The test is
  whether the picture is nodes and edges. Something that is a
  table with lines drawn on it is a table.
- Pick the diagram type that matches the claim: `flowchart` for
  components and data flow, `sequenceDiagram` for an ordered
  exchange between parties, `stateDiagram-v2` for a state
  machine, `erDiagram` for data relationships. A sequence drawn
  as a flowchart has thrown away the ordering it existed to show.
- A new ASCII box-and-arrow diagram in the diff is a finding.
  Converting one the diff already touches is in scope; converting
  every other diagram in the file is not, because a sweep is its
  own change and its own review.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

 * Has `AGENTS.md` been updated?
 * Is all deferred work and pre-existing errors listed in a plan
   file?

<!-- shared-block: plan-phase-references v1 -->
Plan phase references (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-phase-references.md`):

- Documentation outside plans directories describes the current
  state of the software, not the history of how it was built. Do
  not write "implemented in phase 5" or "since phase 3 of the
  two-tier CI plan": a reader wants to know whether a feature
  exists, not which phase of which plan delivered it.
- If a documented behaviour is implemented, describe it plainly.
  If it is planned but not yet implemented, link to the master
  plan in `docs/plans/` instead of citing a phase number.
- Reserve the word "phase" for plan documents. A procedural
  document describing a live multi-stage process (a release
  runbook, say) should call its stages "steps" or "stages", so
  that a phase reference in `docs/` is always a plan smell.
- The consistency audit greps `README.md` and `docs/` (excluding
  plans directories) for "phase <number>". Append
  `<!-- audit-ok: phase-reference -->` to a line only when the
  reference is genuinely not about an implementation plan.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

## Security review

 * Review these changes as both a security reviewer and an
   experienced developer and correct any errors you find.
 * Are any user-controlled values (registry responses, image
   names, labels) used in file paths, HTTP headers, or shell
   commands without sanitization?

<!-- shared-block: path-traversal-review v1 -->
Path construction from outside data (shared block; do not edit --
the canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/path-traversal-review.md`):

- Treat as a candidate any filesystem path built from a value the
  process did not choose: a request parameter, an image name, tag or
  digest, a layer path, an archive member name, a filename out of a
  configuration file or a database row.
- The question is not whether the value looks dangerous but whether
  the resulting path is *proved* to stay inside its intended base
  directory. Resolve the joined path with `os.path.realpath()` and
  verify it still starts with the base; a check on the untrusted
  component alone is defeated by symlinks and by encodings the
  check did not anticipate.
- Prefer a helper that cannot be forgotten at a call site --
  `safe_path_join()` in occystrap, or the framework's own
  (`send_from_directory` in Flask) -- over an inline guard repeated
  at each join.
- Archive extraction is the case most often missed: a member name
  inside a tarball or zip is attacker-controlled in exactly the same
  way as a request parameter.
- Where a bare join is correct because every component is
  process-chosen, say so in a comment rather than leaving the
  reader to re-derive it.

## Build verification

 * Does `pip install -e .` succeed?
 * Does `tox` pass?
